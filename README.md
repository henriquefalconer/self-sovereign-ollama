# private-ai-api

A monorepo containing both the private AI server and client components for running a fully private, OpenAI-compatible LLM inference infrastructure.

## Project Structure

This monorepo contains two main components:

- **server/** – The private AI server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API
- **client/** – Client-side setup and configuration for connecting to the server

## Overview

The private-ai-api project provides a complete solution for running large language models on your own hardware with zero public internet exposure and zero third-party cloud dependencies.

### Server (private-ai-server)
- Runs on a dedicated Apple Silicon Mac with high unified memory
- Exposes OpenAI-compatible `/v1` API endpoints
- Accessible only via secure overlay network (Tailscale)
- 24/7 operation for on-demand inference

### Client (private-ai-client)
- macOS environment setup and configuration
- Connects to the server via Tailscale
- Configures tools like Aider to use the private API automatically
- Zero manual configuration per session

## Quick Start

### Server Setup
See [server/README.md](server/README.md) for detailed server installation and configuration.

### Client Setup
See [client/README.md](client/README.md) for client installation and usage.

## Network Architecture

- **No public internet exposure** – All access via Tailscale private network
- **Device-level authorization** – Tailscale ACLs control access
- **OpenAI-compatible** – Works with any tool supporting custom OpenAI base URLs

## Requirements

### Server
- Apple Silicon Mac (M-series) with ≥96 GB unified memory recommended
- macOS 14 Sonnet or later
- High upload bandwidth (≥100 Mb/s recommended)
- 24/7 operation capability

### Client
- macOS 14 Sonnet or later
- Homebrew
- Python 3.10+
- Tailscale account

## Documentation

- [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) – Implementation roadmap
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) – Agent roles and responsibilities
- [server/SETUP.md](server/SETUP.md) – Server setup instructions
- [client/SETUP.md](client/SETUP.md) – Client setup instructions

## Security Model

- Network-layer isolation via Tailscale
- No built-in authentication (relies on network security)
- No ports exposed to public internet
- Tag-based access control
