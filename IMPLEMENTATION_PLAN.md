# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for both the private-ai-server and private-ai-client components.

## Important Note

This file should be created during actual implementation and updated as the project evolves. The specifications in the `server/specs/` and `client/specs/` directories provide the requirements and design details.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Server Setup (private-ai-server)
1. Review all specifications in `server/specs/`
2. Implement `server/scripts/install.sh`
3. Implement `server/scripts/warm-models.sh`
4. Test Ollama service configuration
5. Verify Tailscale integration
6. Test API endpoints against OpenAI compatibility

### Phase 2: Client Setup (private-ai-client)
1. Review all specifications in `client/specs/`, especially `API_CONTRACT.md`
2. Create `client/config/env.template`
3. Implement `client/scripts/install.sh`
4. Implement `client/scripts/uninstall.sh`
5. Test Aider integration
6. Verify end-to-end connectivity

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. Full server-client communication test
2. Tailscale ACL validation
3. Model loading and inference testing
4. Streaming response validation
5. Tool calling verification (if supported by model)

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. Update all README files with actual usage examples
2. Add troubleshooting guides
3. Document common issues and solutions
4. Create quick reference guides

## Notes for Implementation

- All code should follow the principles outlined in the architecture specs
- Security requirements from `server/specs/SECURITY.md` are non-negotiable
- API contract in `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` must be strictly followed
- No public internet exposure at any stage
- Test on fresh macOS installations when possible

## Current Status

Status will be tracked here during implementation.
