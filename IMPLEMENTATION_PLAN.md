## Implementation Status (v0.0.4) ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIX COMPLETE

**⚠️ Critical bug discovered in v0.0.3 during real-world Aider usage (2026-02-10)**

**Bug**: `OLLAMA_API_BASE` incorrectly set to `http://ai-server:11434/v1` in API contract specification. This causes Aider/LiteLLM to construct invalid URLs like `http://ai-server:11434/v1/api/show` (combining OpenAI prefix `/v1` with Ollama native endpoint `/api/show`), resulting in 404 errors.

**Root Cause**: Spec files defined `OLLAMA_API_BASE` with `/v1` suffix, but Ollama-aware tools need to access native endpoints at `/api/*` (without `/v1` prefix) for model metadata operations.

**Fix Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-10). All implementation files updated to match corrected specs. Hardware testing required to verify fix on real systems.

---

### v0.0.3 Status Summary (2026-02-10)

Re-audited 2026-02-10 (fourth pass) with exhaustive line-by-line spec-vs-implementation comparison using parallel Opus/Sonnet subagents. All 35 previously identified gaps re-confirmed. **16 additional gaps** found across all scripts. Total: **51 spec compliance gaps**. **ALL 51 spec compliance gaps FIXED** as of 2026-02-10.

**However**: Critical environment variable bug not caught by automated tests (tests validated API endpoints work but did not run Aider end-to-end).

- ✅ **Client hardware testing COMPLETE** (all 27 tests passed on vm@macos, 2026-02-10)
- ✅ **Documentation polish COMPLETE** (Priority E: all 4 tasks done)

# Implementation Plan

Prioritized task list for achieving full spec implementation of both server and client components.

## Current Status

- **Specifications**: ✅ UPDATED (2026-02-10) - Fixed `OLLAMA_API_BASE` bug in 3 spec files
  - ✅ `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` - Corrected `OLLAMA_API_BASE` to `http://ai-server:11434` (no `/v1` suffix)
  - ✅ `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` - Updated test validation to check for correct URL format
  - ✅ `server/specs/INTERFACES.md` - Added note about Ollama native endpoints
- **Implementation files**: ✅ ALL UPDATED (2026-02-10) - All files now match corrected specs
  - ✅ `client/config/env.template` - Updated to `OLLAMA_API_BASE` without `/v1` suffix
  - ✅ `client/scripts/install.sh` - Uses corrected env.template
  - ✅ `client/scripts/test.sh` - Validates correct URL format, includes end-to-end Aider test
  - ⚠️ All deployed installations - Require manual fix or re-install (see troubleshooting in documentation)
- **Documentation**: ✅ UPDATED (2026-02-10) - All user-facing docs reflect corrected environment variables
- **Server implementation**: ✅ No changes needed (server serves both `/v1/*` and `/api/*` endpoints)
- **Testing**: ✅ END-TO-END TEST ADDED - Test 26 in client/scripts/test.sh validates Aider functionality

## Remaining Work (Priority Order)

✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIX COMPLETE** - v0.0.4 code changes complete (2026-02-10)

v0.0.3 contained a critical environment variable bug discovered during real-world Aider usage. All code changes have been implemented. Hardware testing is the only remaining task before v0.0.4 release.

### Priority G: Critical Bug Fix - OLLAMA_API_BASE ✅ COMPLETE

**Discovered**: 2026-02-10 during first real Aider usage attempt
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Aider completely non-functional with current configuration
**Impact**: All v0.0.3 installations broken for Aider usage
**Status**: ✅ ALL CODE CHANGES COMPLETE (2026-02-10) - Hardware testing pending

**Tasks**:
- ✅ Update `client/config/env.template` line 4: Changed `OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://__HOSTNAME__:11434/v1` to `OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://__HOSTNAME__:11434` (removed `/v1` suffix)
- ✅ Update `client/scripts/test.sh` environment validation to check for correct URL format (no `/v1` on OLLAMA_API_BASE, WITH `/v1` on OPENAI_API_BASE)
- ✅ Add end-to-end Aider test to `client/scripts/test.sh` to catch runtime integration issues (test 26 added, TOTAL_TESTS incremented to 28)
- ✅ Update all user-facing documentation (README.md, SETUP.md) to reflect corrected environment variables
- ✅ Add troubleshooting section for users with v0.0.3 installations (added to client/README.md and client/SETUP.md)
- ⚠️ Re-run client hardware testing with corrected configuration (code complete, testing pending on real hardware)
- ✅ Document lessons learned: automated tests must include end-to-end validation, not just API endpoint checks (documented in "Post-Release Critical Finding" section below)

**Specs already fixed** (2026-02-10):
- ✅ `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` - Corrected and added rationale
- ✅ `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` - Updated validation requirements
- ✅ `server/specs/INTERFACES.md` - Added clarifying note

**Completion Note**: All code changes for the critical bug fix are complete. The corrected configuration needs to be validated on real hardware with an actual Aider workflow. Users with v0.0.3 installations can fix their setup by manually editing `~/.ai-client/env` or re-running the install script.

---

## Post-Release Critical Finding (v0.0.3)

### Bug Discovery Timeline

1. **2026-02-10 morning**: All 47 automated tests passed (20 server + 27 client)
2. **2026-02-10 afternoon**: v0.0.3 declared production-ready
3. **2026-02-10 evening**: First real Aider usage attempt fails with 404 errors
4. **Root cause identified**: `OLLAMA_API_BASE` set to `http://remote-ollama:11434/v1` causes Aider/LiteLLM to construct invalid URL `http://remote-ollama:11434/v1/api/show`

### Why Automated Tests Didn't Catch This

**What the tests validated:**
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible endpoints work: `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`
- ✅ Aider binary is installed and in PATH
- ✅ Environment variables are set and exported
- ✅ All documented API endpoints respond correctly

**What the tests MISSED:**
- ❌ Aider's actual runtime behavior when fetching model metadata
- ❌ Ollama native endpoint access at `/api/show` (not part of documented API contract)
- ❌ End-to-end tool usage with real prompts

**Test Design Flaw**: Tests validated individual components (API works, Aider installed, env vars set) but not the **integration** of all components during actual tool usage.

### Technical Analysis

**The Problem:**
Ollama serves two distinct API surfaces:
1. **OpenAI-compatible**: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models` (documented in our API contract)
2. **Ollama native**: `/api/show`, `/api/tags`, `/api/chat` (undocumented, but used by Ollama-aware tools)

Aider/LiteLLM uses:
- `OPENAI_API_BASE` for chat requests → needs `/v1` suffix ✅
- `OLLAMA_API_BASE` for metadata requests → needs NO suffix ❌

**The Fix:**
```bash
# Before (broken):
OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://ai-server:11434/v1
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://ai-server:11434/v1

# After (correct):
OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://ai-server:11434      # No /v1 - for native endpoints
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://ai-server:11434/v1   # With /v1 - for OpenAI endpoints
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **End-to-end testing is mandatory** - Component tests are insufficient for integration validation
2. **Test the primary use case** - Aider is the only supported v1 interface; it must be tested end-to-end
3. **Tool behavior != API behavior** - Tools may use APIs in unexpected ways; must test with actual tools, not just curl
4. **Undocumented features matter** - Even though `/api/show` isn't in our API contract, tools depend on it
5. **Real-world usage is the ultimate test** - Automated tests gave false confidence

### Required Test Enhancement

Add to `client/scripts/test.sh`:
```bash
# End-to-end Aider test (non-interactive)
echo "test prompt" | aider --yes --message "respond with 'ok'" --model ollama/qwen2.5:0.5b
```

This would have immediately exposed the `/v1/api/show` 404 error during testing.

  - Spec: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 54 — Show what was "successfully removed"
  - Fix applied: Now tracks what was actually removed in REMOVED_ITEMS array; only lists Aider if removed

- ✅ **F6.3 — Static summary always lists shell profile modifications as removed** (HIGH) — FIXED
  - Spec: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 54 — Show what was "successfully removed"
  - Fix applied: Conditionally adds to REMOVED_ITEMS only if shell profile modifications were actually removed

- ✅ **F6.4 — Static summary always lists config directory as removed** (HIGH) — FIXED
  - Spec: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 54 — Show what was "successfully removed"
  - Fix applied: Conditionally adds to REMOVED_ITEMS only if config directory existed and was removed

- ✅ **F6.5 — Terminal reload reminder outside summary box** (LOW) — FIXED
  - Spec: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` lines 54-57 — Summary should include reminder to close/reopen terminal
  - Fix applied: Moved terminal reminder inside summary box

- ✅ **F6.6 — No tracking of Aider removal failure state** (MEDIUM) — FIXED
  - Spec: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 58 — "Graceful degradation: continue with remaining cleanup even if some steps fail"
  - Fix applied: Tracks failures in REMOVAL_FAILURES array and displays in summary if any failures occurred

#### F7. UX Consistency Across All Scripts -- ✅ ALL 4 gaps FIXED

These are patterns where the specs require "consistent standards" but scripts differ:

- ✅ **F7.1 — Inconsistent color palette** (LOW) — FIXED
  - Spec: All scripts should define consistent color variables
  - Fix applied: Standardize all scripts to define RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, NC at minimum

- ✅ **F7.2 — Inconsistent visual hierarchy** (LOW) — FIXED
  - Spec: Consistent visual styling across all scripts
  - Fix applied: Standardize on box-drawing characters for all scripts or standardize on simple `===` separators

- ✅ **F7.3 — server/scripts/install.sh does not validate user shell is zsh or bash** (LOW) — FIXED
  - Spec: `server/specs/REQUIREMENTS.md` line 7 — "zsh (default) or bash" listed as system requirement
  - Fix applied: Added shell validation matching client install.sh pattern

- ✅ **F7.4 — warm-models.sh banner missing "ai-server" prefix** (LOW) — FIXED
  - Spec: All scripts should use component-specific prefix in banners
  - Fix applied: Rename to "ai-server Model Warming Script" for consistency

### Non-Critical Spec Observations (informational)

These are minor spec-vs-implementation discrepancies that are defensible design choices, not bugs:

1. **Homebrew "checks / installs"**: Both `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 6 and `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 5 say "Checks / installs Homebrew", but both install scripts only check and fatal-exit if missing (do not offer to install). This is a reasonable safety choice since Homebrew installation requires `/bin/bash -c "$(curl ...)"` which is destructive. The spec could be read as "enforces Homebrew is present."

2. **Server install.sh Tailscale machine name**: `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 16 says "Prompts user to set Tailscale machine name" but the implementation only displays instructions (no interactive `read` prompt). Acceptable because machine name is set in the Tailscale admin console, not via CLI.

3. **Client connectivity diagnostics**: `client/specs/FUNCTIONALITIES.md` lines 17-19 says "Provide clear error messages if Tailscale is not joined or tag is missing." The implementation provides a generic bullet list of possible reasons rather than diagnosing the specific issue. A future enhancement could run `tailscale status` to differentiate scenarios.

4. **`server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 5 generality**: Says "Validates macOS + Apple Silicon hardware requirements" without specifying "macOS 14 Sonoma". The implementation correctly validates macOS 14+ (matching `server/specs/REQUIREMENTS.md`), but the SCRIPTS.md spec is less specific. Not a code bug -- REQUIREMENTS.md is the authoritative source for version requirements.

5. **`warm-models.sh` absent from user-facing docs**: `server/README.md` and `server/SETUP.md` do not mention the `warm-models.sh` script, despite it being fully implemented and spec'd in `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` lines 25-33 and `server/specs/FILES.md` line 16. Users would not discover this useful optional script from the documentation. Tracked in Priority E/7.

## Spec Audit Summary

Every spec file was read and cross-referenced. Findings are grouped below.

### Files required by specs (from FILES.md)

| Component | File | Spec Source | Status |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| Client | `client/config/env.template` | `client/specs/FILES.md` line 16 | COMPLETE |
| Server | `server/scripts/install.sh` | `server/specs/FILES.md` line 14 | COMPLETE |
| Server | `server/scripts/uninstall.sh` | `server/specs/FILES.md` line 15 | COMPLETE |
| Client | `client/scripts/install.sh` | `client/specs/FILES.md` line 12 | COMPLETE |
| Client | `client/scripts/uninstall.sh` | `client/specs/FILES.md` line 13 | COMPLETE |
| Server | `server/scripts/warm-models.sh` | `server/specs/FILES.md` line 16 | COMPLETE |
| Server | `server/scripts/test.sh` | `server/specs/FILES.md` line 17 | COMPLETE |
| Client | `client/scripts/test.sh` | `client/specs/FILES.md` line 14 | COMPLETE |

### Cross-spec findings

1. **server/SETUP.md uses deprecated launchctl API**: Line 61 uses `launchctl load -w`; step 4 (lines 64-69) mixes `brew services restart ollama` with the manual plist from step 3. These conflict. The install script must use `launchctl bootstrap` / `launchctl bootout` exclusively and disable brew services for Ollama.

2. **curl-pipe URL corrected**: `client/SETUP.md` line 12 now correctly references branch `master` (repository's default branch).

3. **curl-pipe install requires self-contained script**: `client/SETUP.md` line 12 references `bash <(curl -fsSL ...install.sh)`. When piped, `$0` is `bash` and there is no filesystem context. The script cannot assume `../config/env.template` exists. **Prescribed solution**: embed the env.template content as a heredoc fallback inside install.sh. If the file exists on disk (local clone mode), read it; otherwise use the embedded copy. This makes the script self-contained for curl-pipe while still using the canonical template file when available.

4. **API contract defines 4 environment variables** (`client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` lines 39-43): `OLLAMA_API_BASE`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and optionally `AIDER_MODEL`. The env.template and install script must set all four (with AIDER_MODEL commented out as optional). Variables must use `export` so they propagate to child processes like Aider.

5. **Server security constraints** (`server/specs/SECURITY.md` lines 20-24): Ollama logs must remain local, no outbound telemetry, avoid running as root, regular updates for macOS/Tailscale/Ollama only. The launchd plist is a user-level LaunchAgent (in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`), which inherently runs as the user -- not root. The install script must validate this.

6. **Server CORS** (`server/specs/SECURITY.md` lines 26-29): Default Ollama CORS restrictions apply. The install script should NOT set `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` in v1 but should include a comment in the plist section documenting it as an optional future enhancement.

7. **Tailscale ACL snippet** (`server/SETUP.md` lines 86-96, `server/specs/SECURITY.md` lines 11-12): The server install script should print the full ACL JSON snippet for the user to apply in the Tailscale admin console, including tag-based rules (`tag:ai-client` -> `tag:ai-server:11434`) and machine name guidance.

8. **Client connectivity test** (`client/specs/FUNCTIONALITIES.md` lines 17-19): The install script must test connectivity and provide clear error messages if Tailscale is not connected or the server is unreachable. Per `FUNCTIONALITIES.md` line 18 this test is described as "optional" -- the script must **warn but not abort** if the server is unreachable.

9. **server/SETUP.md hardcodes Ollama path**: Line 41 uses `/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama`. This is correct for Apple Silicon Homebrew but the install script should validate the path exists before writing it into the plist (use `which ollama` or `brew --prefix`/`bin/ollama` as fallback).

10. **client/SETUP.md "with user consent"**: Line 32 says the installer will "Update your shell profile (~/.zshrc) to source the environment". `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 9 specifies "(with user consent)". The install script must interactively prompt before modifying `~/.zshrc`.

11. **pipx ensurepath timing**: After `brew install pipx`, `pipx ensurepath` must be called to add `~/.local/bin` to PATH. This must happen before `pipx install aider-chat` so the aider binary is findable. Additionally, the shell profile sourcing line must come before the pipx PATH additions, or the user must open a new terminal.

12. **curl-pipe uninstall documented**: `client/SETUP.md` lines 68-72 now documents both uninstall paths (local clone: `./scripts/uninstall.sh`, curl-pipe: `~/.ai-client/uninstall.sh`). Install.sh must copy uninstall.sh to `~/.ai-client/uninstall.sh` during installation.

13. **`/v1/responses` endpoint version requirement documented**: `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` line 26 now notes "requires Ollama 0.5.0+ (experimental)". The integration testing phase must verify this endpoint works with documented version.

14. **All 4 API contract endpoints are covered by Ollama**: `/v1/chat/completions` (core), `/v1/models` (listing), `/v1/models/{model}` (detail), and `/v1/responses` (experimental). No custom server code is needed -- Ollama serves all of these natively. The install script just needs to ensure Ollama is running and bound to all interfaces.

15. **Marker comment pattern for shell profile**: The install script must use a consistent marker pattern (`# >>> ai-client >>>` / `# <<< ai-client <<<`) to delimit the sourcing block in `~/.zshrc` and `~/.bashrc`. This enables idempotent insertion (skip if markers already present) and clean removal by uninstall.sh (delete everything between markers inclusive).

16. **"Sonnet" vs "Sonoma" typo corrected**: All READMEs (`server/README.md` line 19, `client/README.md` line 24, root `README.md` lines 51/56) now correctly say "macOS 14 Sonoma".

### Priority ordering rationale

1. **env.template first** -- trivial, zero dependencies, unblocks client install script
2. **Server install.sh** -- largest and most complex script; independent of client; unblocks warm-models.sh
3. **Client install.sh** -- depends on env.template; can be tested independently of server (connectivity test warns but does not abort)
4. **Client uninstall.sh** -- must exactly reverse what install.sh creates
5. **Server warm-models.sh** -- optional enhancement; depends on server being installed
6. **Integration testing** -- now subdivided into three tasks:
   - **6a: Server test.sh** -- automated test suite for server functionality; depends on Priority 2
   - **6b: Client test.sh** -- automated test suite for client functionality; depends on Priority 3
   - **6c: Hardware testing** -- run test scripts and manual tests on real hardware; depends on 6a, 6b, and 1-5
7. **Documentation polish** -- requires 1-6 to validate accuracy

This ordering is optimal because: (a) the trivial file is first to unblock downstream work; (b) server and client install scripts are independent and could theoretically be parallelized, but server is listed first because it has zero dependencies while client depends on Priority 1; (c) uninstall.sh must be written after install.sh to ensure exact reversal; (d) warm-models.sh is optional and can be deferred; (e) test scripts provide automated validation before manual hardware testing.

## Priority 1 -- Client: `client/config/env.template`

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Effort**: Trivial (~8 lines)
**Dependencies**: None
**Blocks**: Priority 3 (client install.sh reads this template)

**Spec refs**:
- `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` lines 20-23: "Template showing the exact variables required by the contract; Used by install.sh to create `~/.ai-client/env`"
- `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` lines 39-43: exact variable names and values
- `client/specs/FILES.md` line 16: file location `client/config/env.template`

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create `client/config/` directory
- [x] Create `env.template` with the following content:
  ```bash
  # ai-client environment configuration
  # Source: client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md
  # Generated from env.template by install.sh -- do not edit manually
  export OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://__HOSTNAME__:11434
  export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://__HOSTNAME__:11434/v1
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
  # export AIDER_MODEL=ollama/<model-name>
  ```
- [x] Use `__HOSTNAME__` as the placeholder (install.sh substitutes with actual hostname, default `remote-ollama`)
- [x] Include `export` on each variable so they propagate to child processes when sourced
- [x] Keep `AIDER_MODEL` commented out (optional per API contract)

---

## Implementation Constraints (from specs)

These constraints apply to ALL implementation work and are non-negotiable:

1. **Security** (`server/specs/SECURITY.md`): No public internet exposure. No built-in auth -- relies entirely on Tailscale isolation. Ollama must not run as root. Logs remain local, no telemetry.

2. **API contract** (`client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md`): Single source of truth for the server-client interface. Client configures exactly these env vars and relies only on documented endpoints. Server guarantees all documented endpoints and behaviors.

3. **Independence** (`AGENTS.md`): Server and client remain independent except via the API contract.

4. **Idempotency**: All scripts must be safe to re-run without breaking existing setup.

5. **No stubs**: Implement completely or not at all.

6. **macOS only (v1)**: Server requires Apple Silicon. Client requires macOS 14+ (Sonoma).

7. **Aider is the only v1 interface** (`client/specs/ARCHITECTURE.md` line 7): But the env var setup ensures any OpenAI-compatible tool works automatically.

8. **curl-pipe install support** (`client/SETUP.md` lines 11-13): Client install.sh must work when piped from curl. Solution: embed env.template as heredoc fallback; copy uninstall.sh to `~/.ai-client/`.

## Spec Audit Findings (2026-02-10, re-audited 2026-02-10, v3 2026-02-10)

### Spec consistency audit
A comprehensive audit of all 13 specification files was performed to validate internal consistency, cross-file consistency, and completeness:

- **No internal contradictions**: Each spec file is internally consistent with no conflicting requirements
- **No cross-file contradictions**: All cross-spec dependencies verified; no conflicting requirements between files
- **All requirements satisfiable**: Current implementation scope can fully satisfy all documented requirements
- **No TODO/FIXME markers**: All spec files and implementation scripts are complete for v1 scope with no placeholder sections

### Implementation-vs-spec audit (updated 2026-02-10, v4.3)
Every implemented script was compared line-by-line against its spec requirements using parallel Opus/Sonnet subagents. Fourth audit pass; all 35 previously identified gaps re-confirmed, 16 additional gaps found across all scripts. Total: 51 gaps. **31 gaps fixed as of 2026-02-10. Remaining: 20 gaps.**

## Prioritized Implementation Items

---

### H1-1: Fix client/README.md documentation accuracy (BLOCKING)

- **Priority**: H1 (critical -- misleads users NOW about non-existent features)
- **What**: The client README.md (lines 42-44, 163-165, 170-178) references `check-compatibility.sh`, `pin-versions.sh`, and `downgrade-claude.sh` as if they exist and are usable. It also presents Claude Code integration (alias setup, backend options) as available during installation, but `install.sh` has no Claude Code support. This is misleading for any user who reads the README today.
- **Action**: Add a clear "v2+ Planned Features" disclaimer section. Move all v2+ references (version management scripts, Claude Code integration, analytics) under that section with a note that they are not yet implemented. Alternatively, revert the README to only document v1 features and add a "Roadmap" section at the bottom.
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/FILES.md` lines 21-23 (lists v2+ scripts), `client/specs/FUNCTIONALITIES.md` lines 12-44 (v2+ functionalities)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Trivial (text edits only)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

### H1-2: Update server/specs/SCRIPTS.md to specify /v1/messages tests

- **Priority**: H1 (spec gap -- must be closed before implementing server v2+ tests)
- **What**: `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` defines test.sh behavior (lines 125-189) but only specifies OpenAI API endpoint tests (`/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`). The Anthropic-compatible endpoint `POST /v1/messages` is not mentioned despite being documented in `server/specs/INTERFACES.md` (lines 30-50) and thoroughly specified in `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md`. The spec must be updated to include `/v1/messages` test requirements before implementation.
- **Action**: Add a new "Anthropic API Endpoint Tests (v2+)" subsection to `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` under the test.sh section, specifying tests for:
  - `POST /v1/messages` non-streaming request succeeds
  - `POST /v1/messages` streaming request returns correct SSE event types
  - `POST /v1/messages` with system prompt
  - `POST /v1/messages` error behavior (nonexistent model)
  - Optional: tool use, thinking blocks (model-dependent)
- **Spec references**: `server/specs/INTERFACES.md` lines 30-50, `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md` lines 43-125 (endpoint spec), `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` lines 125-189 (test.sh spec)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Small (spec text only, no code)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

### H1-3: Add /v1/messages tests to server/scripts/test.sh

- **Priority**: H1 (critical v2+ blocking -- validates that the Anthropic API surface works)
- **What**: `server/scripts/test.sh` currently has 20 tests covering only OpenAI API endpoints. It does not test the Anthropic-compatible `POST /v1/messages` endpoint at all, despite `server/specs/INTERFACES.md` and `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md` documenting it as a supported API surface. Since Ollama 0.5.0+ provides this natively, no server code changes are needed -- only test coverage.
- **Action**: Add new tests to `server/scripts/test.sh`:
  1. `POST /v1/messages` non-streaming with text content (verify response has `id`, `type`, `role`, `content`, `stop_reason`, `usage`)
  2. `POST /v1/messages` streaming (verify SSE event sequence: `message_start`, `content_block_start`, `content_block_delta`, `content_block_stop`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`)
  3. `POST /v1/messages` with system prompt (verify system prompt is processed)
  4. `POST /v1/messages` error case (nonexistent model returns appropriate error)
  5. Optional/skippable: tool use test, thinking blocks test (model-dependent)
  - Update `TOTAL_TESTS` counter accordingly
  - Add `--skip-anthropic-tests` flag for environments with Ollama <0.5.0
- **Spec references**: `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md` lines 43-125 (request/response format), `server/specs/INTERFACES.md` lines 30-50
- **Dependencies**: H1-2 (spec must be updated first)
- **Effort**: Medium (4-6 new tests, following existing test patterns)

---

### H1-4: Add Claude Code integration to client/scripts/install.sh

- **Priority**: H1 (critical v2+ blocking -- this is the primary entry point for Claude Code + Ollama setup)
- **What**: `client/scripts/install.sh` currently only sets up Aider (v1). Per `client/specs/CLAUDE_CODE.md` lines 238-285 and `client/specs/FUNCTIONALITIES.md` lines 14-19, the install script should, after the Aider setup, optionally offer Claude Code + Ollama integration. This includes: prompting the user, creating the `claude-ollama` shell alias with proper marker comments (`# >>> claude-ollama >>>` / `# <<< claude-ollama <<<`), and adding Anthropic environment variables to the env file or as part of the alias.
- **Action**:
  1. After the existing Aider installation section, add a new optional section: "Claude Code + Ollama Integration"
  2. Display info about benefits/limitations (per `CLAUDE_CODE.md` lines 259-276)
  3. Prompt user: "Create 'claude-ollama' shell alias? (y/N)"
  4. If yes: append `claude-ollama` alias to shell profile with marker comments (per `client/specs/FILES.md` lines 70-72)
  5. The alias should be: `alias claude-ollama='ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=ollama ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="" ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://<hostname>:11434 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'`
  6. Use the same hostname captured during the Aider env setup
  7. Maintain idempotency: check for existing `claude-ollama` markers before appending
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/CLAUDE_CODE.md` lines 238-285 (installation integration), `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` lines 141-164 (Anthropic env vars and alias), `client/specs/FILES.md` lines 70-72 (shell profile markers), `client/specs/FUNCTIONALITIES.md` lines 14-19
- **Dependencies**: None (can proceed in parallel with H1-2/H1-3)
- **Effort**: Medium (add ~60-80 lines to existing install.sh)

---

### H1-5: Add Anthropic env vars to client/config/env.template

- **Priority**: H1 (supports H1-4)
- **What**: `client/config/env.template` currently contains only 4 OpenAI/Aider variables. Per `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` lines 141-164, the Anthropic variables (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) should be available for users who opt into Claude Code integration. These should be commented out by default (similar to `AIDER_MODEL`) since the Claude Code integration is optional.
- **Action**: Add commented-out Anthropic variables to `env.template`:
  ```
  # Claude Code + Ollama (optional, uncomment if using claude-ollama alias)
  # export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=ollama
  # export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
  # export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://__HOSTNAME__:11434
  ```
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` lines 149-153 (Anthropic env vars)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Trivial
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

### H1-6: Sync install.sh embedded env template with canonical env.template (Anthropic vars missing)

- **Priority**: H1 (medium -- curl-pipe install path produces incomplete env file)
- **What**: `client/scripts/install.sh` lines 311-319 contain an embedded env template used during curl-pipe mode (`curl | bash`). This embedded template was not updated when H1-5 added commented-out Anthropic variables to the canonical `client/config/env.template`. As a result, users who install via `curl | bash` (the primary install method documented in `client/SETUP.md`) get an env file missing the Anthropic variable comments, while users who install from a local clone get the complete template. The two templates must stay in sync.
- **Action**:
  1. Copy the commented-out Anthropic variable block from `client/config/env.template` into the embedded template in `install.sh` (around lines 311-319)
  2. Ensure the embedded template matches the canonical template exactly
  3. Add a code comment in `install.sh` near the embedded template: `# IMPORTANT: Keep in sync with client/config/env.template`
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` lines 149-153 (Anthropic env vars)
- **Dependencies**: H1-5 (already complete), can be bundled with H1-4 or done standalone
- **Effort**: Trivial (copy 4 lines from one location to another)

---

### H2-1: Create client/scripts/check-compatibility.sh

- **Priority**: H2 (important v2+ -- enables safe Claude Code updates)
- **What**: This script does not exist. Per `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 82-131, it should verify that the installed Claude Code version and the remote Ollama server version are a tested combination. It embeds a compatibility matrix as a bash associative array, detects both tool versions, and reports compatibility status.
- **Action**: Create `client/scripts/check-compatibility.sh` implementing:
  1. Detect Claude Code version: `claude --version | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'`
  2. Detect Ollama version from server: `curl -sf http://<hostname>:11434/api/version`
  3. Read hostname from `~/.ai-client/env` (parse `OLLAMA_API_BASE`)
  4. Embedded compatibility matrix: `declare -A COMPATIBLE_VERSIONS`
  5. Exit codes: 0=compatible, 1=tool not found/server unreachable, 2=version mismatch, 3=unknown compatibility
  6. Output: version info, compatibility status, recommendations
  7. Mismatch output: show expected Ollama version, suggest `brew upgrade ollama`
  8. Unknown output: suggest testing and adding to matrix
  9. Color-coded output, clear banner, consistent UX with other scripts
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 66-131 (complete check script spec), `client/specs/FILES.md` line 22
- **Dependencies**: None (can be built independently)
- **Effort**: Medium (standalone script, ~100-150 lines)

---

### H2-2: Create client/scripts/pin-versions.sh

- **Priority**: H2 (important v2+ -- enables version stability)
- **What**: This script does not exist. Per `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 133-178, it should detect current Claude Code and Ollama versions, optionally pin them (npm/brew), and create a `~/.ai-client/.version-lock` file recording the known-working combination.
- **Action**: Create `client/scripts/pin-versions.sh` implementing:
  1. Detect Claude Code version and installation method (npm vs Homebrew)
  2. Detect Ollama version from server
  3. For Claude Code (npm): `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@${VERSION}`
  4. For Claude Code (Homebrew): `brew pin claude-code`
  5. For Ollama: display instructions for user to run on server (`brew pin ollama`)
  6. Create `~/.ai-client/.version-lock` with: `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`, `OLLAMA_VERSION`, `TESTED_DATE`, `STATUS=working`
  7. Color-coded output, clear banner
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 133-178 (complete pin script spec), `client/specs/FILES.md` line 22, line 61
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Medium (~80-120 lines)

### H2-3: Create client/scripts/downgrade-claude.sh

- **Priority**: H2 (important v2+ -- enables recovery from breaking updates)
- **What**: This script does not exist. Per `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 180-226, it should read the `.version-lock` file created by `pin-versions.sh` and downgrade Claude Code to the recorded version. Supports both npm and Homebrew installations.
- **Action**: Create `client/scripts/downgrade-claude.sh` implementing:
  1. Check `~/.ai-client/.version-lock` exists (abort with message if not)
  2. Read `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` from lock file
  3. Display current version and target version
  4. Prompt for confirmation: "Continue? (y/N)"
  5. Detect installation method (npm vs Homebrew)
  6. npm: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@${VERSION}`
  7. Homebrew: display manual steps (Homebrew doesn't support easy downgrades)
  8. Verify: check `claude --version` matches target
  9. Report success or failure
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 180-226 (complete downgrade script spec), `client/specs/FILES.md` line 23
- **Dependencies**: H2-2 (depends on pin-versions.sh creating the .version-lock file)
- **Effort**: Small-medium (~60-100 lines)

---

### H2-4: Add v2+ cleanup to client/scripts/uninstall.sh

- **Priority**: H2 (must reverse what H1-4 creates)
- **What**: `client/scripts/uninstall.sh` currently only removes Aider, shell profile ai-client markers, and `~/.ai-client/`. Per `client/specs/FILES.md` lines 70-72, v2+ adds `claude-ollama` alias markers to the shell profile, and per line 61, `~/.ai-client/.version-lock` is created by pin-versions.sh. Uninstall must also remove these.
- **Action**:
  1. Add removal of `claude-ollama` marker-delimited block from shell profile (`# >>> claude-ollama >>>` / `# <<< claude-ollama <<<`)
  2. The `~/.ai-client/.version-lock` file is already covered by the existing `rm -rf ~/.ai-client/` step
  3. Update summary to mention claude-ollama alias removal (if it was present)
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/FILES.md` lines 70-72, `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` lines 41-59
- **Dependencies**: H1-4 (must know what install.sh creates to reverse it)
- **Effort**: Small (~15-25 lines added to existing script)

---

### H2-5: Add v2+ tests to client/scripts/test.sh

- **Priority**: H2 (validates all v2+ client functionality)
- **What**: `client/scripts/test.sh` currently has 28 tests covering only v1 (Aider/OpenAI). Per `client/specs/FUNCTIONALITIES.md` lines 12-44 and `client/specs/CLAUDE_CODE.md`, the following should also be tested:
  - Claude Code binary installed and in PATH (if opted in)
  - `claude-ollama` alias exists in shell profile (if opted in)
  - `POST /v1/messages` endpoint reachable from client
  - Anthropic env vars in alias are correct
  - Version management scripts exist and have valid syntax
  - `.version-lock` file format (if exists)
- **Action**: Add a new "Claude Code Integration Tests (v2+)" category and a "Version Management Tests (v2+)" category. Implement the following filtering flags:
  - `--skip-claude` -- Skip all v2+ tests (Claude Code + version management) when Claude Code is not installed
  - `--v1-only` -- Run only v1 (Aider/OpenAI) tests, skip all v2+ tests
  - `--v2-only` -- Run only v2+ (Claude Code/Anthropic) tests, skip all v1 tests
  Tests to add:
  1. Claude Code binary available (`which claude`)
  2. `claude-ollama` alias present in shell profile (check markers)
  3. `POST /v1/messages` non-streaming request to server succeeds
  4. `POST /v1/messages` streaming returns SSE events
  5. `check-compatibility.sh` exists and has valid syntax
  6. `pin-versions.sh` exists and has valid syntax
  7. `downgrade-claude.sh` exists and has valid syntax
  8. `.version-lock` file format validation (if file exists)
  - Update `TOTAL_TESTS` counter
  - Implement flag parsing in the argument handling section (alongside existing `--verbose`, `--quick`, etc.)
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` lines 61-138, `client/specs/CLAUDE_CODE.md` lines 119-131 (tool use capabilities), `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` lines 75-164 (Anthropic API contract)
- **Dependencies**: H2-6 (client SCRIPTS.md spec must specify v2+ test requirements first), H1-3 (server tests should pass first), H1-4 (install creates what we test), H2-1/H2-2/H2-3 (version scripts must exist)
- **Effort**: Medium (8-10 new tests following existing patterns)

---

### H2-6: Update client/specs/SCRIPTS.md to add v2+ test requirements and cross-references

- **Priority**: H2 (spec gap -- must be closed before implementing v2+ client tests in H2-5)
- **What**: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` only specifies test.sh requirements for v1 (Aider/OpenAI connectivity tests). It does not specify any Claude Code integration tests or Anthropic API connectivity tests. Additionally, it only lists `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, and `test.sh` without referencing the v2+ scripts (`check-compatibility.sh`, `pin-versions.sh`, `downgrade-claude.sh`) which are fully specified in `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md`.
- **Action**:
  1. Add a new "Claude Code Integration Tests (v2+)" subsection to the test.sh section, specifying:
     - Claude Code binary detection test
     - `claude-ollama` alias presence test
     - `POST /v1/messages` non-streaming connectivity test
     - `POST /v1/messages` streaming SSE test
     - `--skip-claude` flag to skip these tests when Claude Code is not installed
  2. Add a new "Version Management Tests (v2+)" subsection specifying:
     - Script existence and syntax validation tests for check-compatibility.sh, pin-versions.sh, downgrade-claude.sh
     - `.version-lock` file format validation test
  3. Add a "v2+ Scripts" section or note at the top of SCRIPTS.md that cross-references `VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` for the full specification of check-compatibility.sh, pin-versions.sh, and downgrade-claude.sh
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` (entire file), `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` (v2+ script specs), `client/specs/CLAUDE_CODE.md` lines 119-131 (tool use capabilities)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Small (spec text only, no code)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### H3-1: Fix analytics bugs and implement missing spec features

- **Priority**: H3 (nice-to-have -- analytics scripts already exist and partially work, but have correctness issues)
- **What**: `loop-with-analytics.sh`, `compare-analytics.sh`, and `ANALYTICS_README.md` all exist at the project root. The `analytics/` directory has one partial run (`run-20260210-064148`). Audit has identified three categories of issues:
  1. **Divide-by-zero bugs**: `loop-with-analytics.sh` line 494 computes `AVG_SUBAGENTS=$((SUB1 / ITER1))` which will crash if no iterations complete (ITER1=0). Similarly, `compare-analytics.sh` lines 88-104 perform division operations that will fail if a run has 0 iterations.
  2. **Missing decision matrix**: Per `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` lines 474-485, `compare-analytics.sh` should auto-generate "Keep Anthropic" vs "Consider Ollama" recommendations based on mode (plan/build) and performance thresholds. This is not implemented.
  3. **Missing mode-specific recommendations**: The spec requires that plan mode should always recommend Anthropic (due to reasoning complexity), while build mode should use conditional logic based on cost/latency/quality thresholds to determine if Ollama is a viable alternative.
- **Action**:
  1. Fix divide-by-zero in `loop-with-analytics.sh`: guard `AVG_SUBAGENTS` computation with `if [ "$ITER1" -gt 0 ]; then ... else AVG_SUBAGENTS=0; fi`
  2. Fix divide-by-zero in `compare-analytics.sh`: guard all division operations in lines 88-104 with zero-iteration checks
  3. Implement decision matrix output in `compare-analytics.sh` per `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` lines 474-485:
     - Accept or detect mode (plan vs build) from run metadata
     - For plan mode: always output "Recommendation: Keep Anthropic (reasoning-intensive workload)"
     - For build mode: compare metrics against thresholds and output "Consider Ollama" or "Keep Anthropic" with rationale
  4. Fix per-iteration cache hit rate formula in `loop-with-analytics.sh` line 268: currently uses `cache_read * 100 / total_input` (where `total_input` includes `input_tokens`), but per `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` lines 468-471 the correct formula is `cache_read * 100 / (cache_creation + cache_read)`. Note: the aggregate calculation at line 535 already uses the correct formula -- this is an inconsistency within the same file. (See also H3-6 for tracking.)
  5. Audit remaining metrics capture against `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` lines 424-438 (implementation requirements)
  6. Validate that `analytics/run-*/summary.md` format matches spec (lines 168-227)
  7. Document any additional gaps and fix if present
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` (entire file, especially lines 424-438, 440-454, 468-471, 474-485), `client/specs/FUNCTIONALITIES.md` lines 22-37
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Medium (bug fixes are small, but decision matrix implementation requires new logic)

---

### H3-2: Hardware testing for v2+ features

- **Priority**: H3 (required before v2+ release, but not blocking development)
- **What**: After all H1 and H2 items are implemented, the complete v2+ feature set must be tested on real hardware with both server and client machines on the same Tailscale network. This includes:
  - Server: `/v1/messages` endpoint tests pass (from H1-3)
  - Client: Claude Code integration works (alias, env vars)
  - Client: Version management scripts function correctly
  - End-to-end: `claude-ollama` alias successfully connects to Ollama and receives a response
- **Action**:
  1. Run `server/scripts/test.sh --verbose` on server machine (should now include Anthropic tests)
  2. Run `client/scripts/test.sh --verbose` on client machine (should now include v2+ tests)
  3. Manual end-to-end: execute `claude-ollama --model <model> -p "Hello, count 1 to 5"` and verify response
  4. Test version management: run check-compatibility, pin-versions, verify .version-lock created
  5. Document results in this implementation plan
- **Spec references**: All v2+ specs
- **Dependencies**: All H1 and H2 items complete
- **Effort**: Large (requires physical access to Apple Silicon machines on Tailscale)

---

### H3-3: Update server/README.md to document Anthropic API testing

- **Priority**: H3 (documentation polish)
- **What**: `server/README.md` documents Anthropic API support (lines 67-83) but the "Testing & Verification" section only shows OpenAI test output. Once H1-3 adds `/v1/messages` tests, the README should be updated to reflect the new test count and show sample Anthropic test output.
- **Action**: After H1-3 and H3-2 are complete, update the server README testing section with:
  1. New total test count (20 + N Anthropic tests)
  2. Sample output showing Anthropic API test results
  3. Note about `--skip-anthropic-tests` flag for Ollama <0.5.0
- **Spec references**: `server/specs/FILES.md`, `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md`
- **Dependencies**: H1-3 (tests must exist), H3-2 (hardware testing provides sample output)
- **Effort**: Trivial

---

### H3-4: Update server/SETUP.md to document Anthropic API

- **Priority**: H3 (documentation gap -- server setup guide is incomplete for v2+)
- **What**: `server/SETUP.md` only documents OpenAI API setup (endpoint testing examples use `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models`). There is no mention of the Anthropic-compatible `POST /v1/messages` endpoint, despite it being thoroughly documented in `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md` and natively supported by Ollama 0.5.0+. Users setting up the server for Claude Code integration have no setup guide.
- **Action**:
  1. Add an "Anthropic API (Claude Code)" section to `server/SETUP.md` covering:
     - Ollama version requirement (0.5.0+) for native Anthropic compatibility
     - How to verify the endpoint works: `curl` example for `POST /v1/messages`
     - Expected response format
     - Link to `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md` for full details
  2. Add a note in the existing "Verify Installation" section that Anthropic API is also available
- **Spec references**: `server/specs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY.md` (entire file), `server/specs/INTERFACES.md` lines 30-50
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Small (documentation text only)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

### H3-5: Update client/SETUP.md to document v2+ features

- **Priority**: H3 (documentation gap -- should be updated after v2+ features are implemented)
- **What**: `client/SETUP.md` only covers Aider (v1) installation via `curl | bash`. There are no instructions for Claude Code setup, no mention of the `claude-ollama` alias, no analytics documentation, and no version management guidance. After v2+ features are implemented (H1-4, H2-1 through H2-3), the setup guide should be updated to cover the full feature set.
- **Action**: After v2+ implementation is complete, update `client/SETUP.md` to add:
  1. "Claude Code Integration (v2+)" section explaining the optional Ollama backend
  2. How to opt into Claude Code during install (or re-run install to add it)
  3. How to use the `claude-ollama` alias
  4. Version management quick-start (check-compatibility, pin-versions, downgrade)
  5. Analytics overview and link to `ANALYTICS_README.md`
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/CLAUDE_CODE.md`, `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md`, `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md`
- **Dependencies**: H1-4, H2-1, H2-2, H2-3 (features must exist before documenting them)
- **Effort**: Small (documentation text only)

---

### H3-6: Fix per-iteration cache hit rate formula in loop-with-analytics.sh

- **Priority**: H3 (medium -- analytics correctness issue, per-iteration metric uses wrong formula)
- **What**: `loop-with-analytics.sh` line 268 computes per-iteration cache hit rate as `cache_read * 100 / total_input` where `total_input` includes `input_tokens` (non-cache tokens). Per `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` lines 468-471, the correct formula is `cache_read * 100 / (cache_creation + cache_read)` -- i.e., cache hits as a percentage of total cacheable tokens only. The aggregate calculation at line 535 of the same file already uses the correct formula, creating an inconsistency within `loop-with-analytics.sh` itself.
- **Action**:
  1. Replace the per-iteration cache hit rate formula at line 268 from `cache_read * 100 / total_input` to `cache_read * 100 / (cache_creation + cache_read)`
  2. Add a guard for the case where `(cache_creation + cache_read) == 0` to avoid divide-by-zero
  3. Verify that the per-iteration summary output matches the aggregate summary output format
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` lines 468-471 (cache hit rate formula)
- **Dependencies**: None, but should be bundled with H3-1 (analytics fix + audit)
- **Effort**: Trivial (single formula change + zero-guard)

---

### H4-1: Fix IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Priority 1 env.template example ✅ COMPLETE

- **Priority**: H4 (internal documentation inconsistency -- no user impact)
- **What**: The Priority 1 section of this file (line 543) still showed the old env.template content with the `/v1` suffix: `export OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://__HOSTNAME__:11434/v1`. The actual `client/config/env.template` file was already fixed to remove `/v1` (as part of the v0.0.4 critical bug fix). This was a stale example in the plan itself that could cause confusion during future audits.
- **Action**: ✅ Updated the code block in Priority 1 to show the corrected URL: `export OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://__HOSTNAME__:11434`
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` (corrected OLLAMA_API_BASE)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Trivial (single line edit in this file)

---

### H4-2: Fix install.sh server hostname default inconsistency with spec

- **Priority**: H4 (low -- likely intentional for specific deployment, but does not match spec)
- **What**: `client/scripts/install.sh` line 289 sets the default server hostname to `"remote-ollama"` when the user does not provide one. However, `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 10 specifies that the default hostname should be `"ai-server"`. This may have been intentionally changed for a specific Tailscale deployment topology, but it creates a spec-vs-implementation mismatch that should be explicitly resolved.
- **Action**:
  1. If `"remote-ollama"` is intentional: update `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` to document `"remote-ollama"` as the default, with a note explaining the naming convention
  2. If `"ai-server"` is correct: update `client/scripts/install.sh` line 289 to use `"ai-server"` as the default
  3. Either way, ensure spec and implementation agree
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 10 (default hostname spec)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Effort**: Trivial (single string change in one file)

---

### H4-3: ANALYTICS_README.md references non-existent check-compatibility.sh

- **Priority**: H4 (low -- documentation references script that does not yet exist)
- **What**: `ANALYTICS_README.md` line 304 references `check-compatibility.sh` as if it already exists. This script is specified in `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` but has not been implemented yet (see H2-1). This creates a misleading reference in the analytics documentation.
- **Action**: This will be auto-resolved when H2-1 creates the `check-compatibility.sh` script. No separate action needed unless H2-1 is deprioritized, in which case a "not yet implemented" note should be added to the ANALYTICS_README.md reference.
- **Spec references**: `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 66-131 (check-compatibility spec)
- **Dependencies**: H2-1 (auto-resolves this issue)
- **Effort**: None (auto-resolved by H2-1)

---

### H4-4: Fix server test.sh show_progress function never called

- **Priority**: H4 (low -- cosmetic issue, all tests still run and report correctly via pass/fail/skip)
- **What**: `server/scripts/test.sh` defines a `show_progress` function at lines 45-48 that increments `CURRENT_TEST` and prints `[Test $CURRENT_TEST/$TOTAL_TESTS]`. However, this function is never called anywhere in the script. The `CURRENT_TEST` variable (line 20) remains at 0 throughout execution. Tests directly call `pass`/`fail`/`skip` without ever calling `show_progress`. As a result, the per-test progress indicator (e.g., "Running test 5/20...") specified in `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 202 is never shown, regardless of verbose mode.
- **Action**:
  1. Add a `show_progress` call before each test or test group in `server/scripts/test.sh`
  2. Verify that `CURRENT_TEST` increments correctly and matches `TOTAL_TESTS` at the end
  3. Optionally: apply the same fix to `client/scripts/test.sh` if the same pattern exists there
- **Spec references**: `server/specs/SCRIPTS.md` line 202 (progress indication requirement)
- **Dependencies**: None, but should be bundled with H1-3 (when adding new Anthropic tests, add `show_progress` calls to all tests)
- **Effort**: Small (add ~20 function calls to existing test script)

**Remaining**: 15 items across Phases 2-4
**Total estimated effort**: ~5-7 days of focused development + hardware testing

## Implementation Constraints (carried forward from v1)

All v1 constraints remain in effect for v2+:

1. **Security**: No public internet exposure. Tailscale-only. No built-in auth.
2. **API contract**: `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` is the single source of truth.
3. **Independence**: Server and client remain independent except via the API contract.
4. **Idempotency**: All scripts must be safe to re-run.
5. **No stubs**: Implement completely or not at all.
6. **macOS only**: Server requires Apple Silicon. Client requires macOS 14+.
7. **Claude Code integration is OPTIONAL**: Always prompt for user consent. Default behavior should not require Claude Code.
8. **Anthropic cloud is the default**: The Ollama backend is an alternative, not a replacement. Never present it as the primary Claude Code backend.

## Resolved Documentation Issues

All previously identified documentation inconsistencies have been corrected (2026-02-10):

1. ✅ **"Sonnet" vs "Sonoma"**: All READMEs now correctly reference "macOS 14 Sonoma"
2. ✅ **SETUP.md deprecated API**: `server/SETUP.md` now uses modern `launchctl bootstrap` command
3. ✅ **SETUP.md conflicting service management**: Removed conflicting `brew services` command; now uses only `launchctl kickstart -k`
4. ✅ **curl-pipe URL branch**: `client/SETUP.md` now uses correct `master` branch in URL
5. ✅ **curl-pipe uninstall path**: `client/SETUP.md` now documents `~/.ai-client/uninstall.sh` for curl-pipe users
6. ✅ **`/v1/responses` endpoint version**: API contract now notes "requires Ollama 0.5.0+ (experimental)"
