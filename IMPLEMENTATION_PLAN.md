## Implementation Constraints

1. **Security**: Tailscale-only network. No public exposure. No built-in auth.
2. **API contract**: `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md` is the single source of truth for server-client interface.
3. **Idempotency**: All scripts must be safe to re-run without side effects.
4. **No stubs**: Implement completely or not at all. No TODO/FIXME/HACK in production code.
5. **Claude Code integration is optional**: Always prompt for user consent. Anthropic cloud is default; Ollama is an alternative.
6. **curl-pipe install**: Client `install.sh` must work when executed via `curl | bash`.

- Fixed step numbering (Step 13 → Step 14 for connectivity test)
- Fully compliant with `client/specs/CLAUDE_CODE.md` lines 171-284

### H1-6: Env Template Sync
**File**: `client/scripts/install.sh`
- Synced embedded env template (lines 311-323) with canonical `client/config/env.template`
- Added missing Anthropic variable comments:
  - `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (line 9 of template)
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (line 10)
  - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (line 11-12 with Ollama example)
- Ensures install.sh accurately reflects all supported environment variables

### H2-1: Version Compatibility Check
**File**: `client/scripts/check-compatibility.sh`
- Compatibility matrix with tested version pairs (Claude Code 2.1.38→Ollama 0.5.4, 2.1.39→0.5.5)
- Auto-detects Claude Code version via `claude --version`
- Queries Ollama server via `/api/version` endpoint (`http://localhost:11434`)
- Loads environment from `~/.ai-client/env` if available
- Exit code 0: Compatible (green success message)

- Queries Ollama server for version via `/api/version` endpoint
- Pins Claude Code automatically based on installation method:
  - npm: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@${VERSION}`
  - brew: `brew pin claude-code`
- Displays server-side Ollama pinning instructions (must run on server)
- Creates `~/.ai-client/.version-lock` file with:
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`, `OLLAMA_VERSION`
  - `TESTED_DATE`, `STATUS=working`
  - `CLAUDE_INSTALL_METHOD`, `OLLAMA_SERVER`

- Skips downgrade if already at target version
- User confirmation prompt before executing downgrade
- Supports npm downgrade: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@{VERSION}`
- For Homebrew: provides manual downgrade instructions (brew doesn't support easy downgrades)
- Verification step after downgrade confirms success
- Color-coded output and comprehensive error handling
- Fully compliant with `client/specs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` lines 180-226

### H2-4: Uninstall v2+ Cleanup
**File**: `client/scripts/uninstall.sh`

- Marker definitions: `CLAUDE_MARKER_START="# >>> claude-ollama >>>"` / `CLAUDE_MARKER_END="# <<< claude-ollama <<<"`
- Extended shell profile cleanup loop to handle both v1 and v2+ markers:
  - v1 markers: `# >>> ai-client >>>` / `# <<< ai-client <<<` (environment sourcing)
  - v2+ markers: `# >>> claude-ollama >>>` / `# <<< claude-ollama <<<` (alias)
- Processes both `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` in user's home directory
- Uses `sed` with backup files for safe, portable removal
- Tracks modification count for summary reporting
- Clean removal with no residual comments or whitespace
- Idempotent: safe to re-run without side effects
- Compliant with marker conventions established in H1-4

### H3-1: Analytics Bug Fixes
**Files**: `client/scripts/compare-analytics.sh`, `client/scripts/loop-with-analytics.sh`
- Fixed divide-by-zero error in `compare-analytics.sh` lines 88-91:

  - Now correctly implements formula per `client/specs/ANALYTICS.md` line 321
  - Formula: `cache_hit_rate = (cache_read / (cache_creation + cache_read)) * 100`
- All fixes comply with analytics specification requirements
- Scripts now handle edge cases (zero iterations, zero tokens) gracefully

### H2-5: Client v2+ Tests Added to test.sh

- Note: Completed WITHOUT requiring H3-2 (hardware testing) as it only involved documentation updates reflecting already-implemented test changes from H1-3

### H4-3: Auto-Resolved Verification
**Status**: Verified auto-resolved (no action required)
- Original issue: Stale reference to `check-compatibility.sh` in `ANALYTICS_README.md` line 304
- Timeline:
  - 2026-02-10 06:44:17: `ANALYTICS_README.md` created with reference to non-existent script
  - 2026-02-10 16:22:46: `check-compatibility.sh` created via H2-1 (10 hours later)
- Verification results:
  - ✓ File exists: `client/scripts/check-compatibility.sh` (4.5KB, executable)
  - ✓ Reference is accurate: `ANALYTICS_README.md` line 304 correctly points to existing file
  - ✓ File is functional: Proper version compatibility checking implementation
- Resolution: Auto-resolved when H2-1 completed, as predicted in task description

**Impact**: Client installation now supports optional Claude Code integration with proper user consent, clear messaging, idempotent alias creation, and accurate env template documentation. Server test suite comprehensively validates both OpenAI and Anthropic API surfaces with proper progress tracking. Complete version management workflow: users can check compatibility, pin working versions, and downgrade to known-good configurations when upgrades break compatibility. Client uninstallation now properly cleans up both v1 environment sourcing and v2+ Claude Code aliases from shell profiles. Analytics scripts are now robust against divide-by-zero errors and correctly calculate cache hit rates per specification. Client test suite validates all v2+ functionality with 12 new tests and flexible filtering flags. Analytics decision matrix provides actionable guidance on operation balance with shallow:deep ratio tracking. Client SETUP.md now comprehensively documents the complete v2+ user experience including installation, usage, version management, analytics workflow, and troubleshooting. Server README.md now accurately reflects v2+ test suite with 26 tests and Anthropic API coverage documentation.

---

## Lessons Learned (v0.0.4)

All 48 automated tests passed, but first real Aider usage failed. Root cause: `OLLAMA_API_BASE` included `/v1` suffix, breaking Ollama native endpoints (`/api/*`). Fix: separate `OLLAMA_API_BASE` (no suffix) from `OPENAI_API_BASE` (with `/v1`). Lesson: end-to-end integration tests with actual tools are mandatory.

---

## Spec Baseline

All work must comply with:
- `server/specs/*.md` (8 files including ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBILITY)
- `client/specs/*.md` (9 files including ANALYTICS, CLAUDE_CODE, VERSION_MANAGEMENT)

Specs are authoritative. Implementation deviations must be corrected unless there is a compelling reason to update the spec.
