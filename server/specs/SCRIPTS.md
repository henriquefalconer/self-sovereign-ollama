# ai-server Scripts

## scripts/install.sh

### System Validation
- Validates macOS 14+ (Sonoma) and Apple Silicon hardware requirements
- Checks / installs Homebrew

### Homebrew Configuration
- Suppresses Homebrew noise: `HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS=1`, `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1`
- Redirects verbose installation output to `/tmp/*.log` files for cleaner UX

### Tailscale Installation & Setup
- Installs Tailscale GUI app via `brew install --cask tailscale`
- Installs Tailscale CLI tools via `brew install tailscale` (required for connection detection)
- Warns user about sudo password prompt before installation
- Opens Tailscale GUI app for first-time setup
- Provides comprehensive first-time setup instructions:
  - System Extension permission (required)
  - Notifications permission (recommended)
  - "Start on login" option (recommended - ensures reconnection after reboot)
  - VPN activation in System Settings if needed
  - Browser authentication with account creation
  - Survey form (can be skipped)
  - Introduction/tutorial (can be skipped)
- Interactive connection flow: user presses Enter when ready (no timeout pressure)
- Intelligent connection detection via `tailscale status` and `tailscale ip -4`
- Context-specific troubleshooting tips if connection fails

### Ollama Installation & Configuration
- Checks / installs Ollama via Homebrew (output redirected to log)
- Stops any existing Ollama service (brew services or launchd) to avoid conflicts
- Creates `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.plist` to run Ollama as user-level service
  - Sets `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` to bind all network interfaces
  - Configures `KeepAlive=true` and `RunAtLoad=true` for automatic startup
  - Logs to `/tmp/ollama.stdout.log` and `/tmp/ollama.stderr.log`
- Loads the plist via `launchctl bootstrap` (modern API)
- Verifies Ollama is listening on port 11434 (retry loop with timeout)
- Verifies process is running as user (not root)
- Runs self-test: `curl -sf http://localhost:11434/v1/models`

### Tailscale Configuration Instructions
- Displays clear, boxed sections for each configuration step
- **Step 1: Machine Name**
  - Provides direct link to Tailscale machines page
  - Shows current Tailscale IP for easy identification
  - Recommends machine name: `remote-ollama`
- **Step 2: ACL Configuration**
  - Instructs user to click "JSON editor" button first (critical step)
  - Provides complete ACL JSON snippet with tags
  - **Step 3: Tag Instructions** with explicit steps:
    - Navigate to machines page
    - Find machine by IP
    - Click three dots menu → "Edit ACL tags..."
    - Add tag in Tags field
    - Save changes
- **Step 3: Optional Model Pre-pull**
  - Shows popular model examples (qwen2.5-coder:32b, deepseek-r1:70b, llama3.2)

### Final Summary
- Visual hierarchy with boxed "Installation Complete" message
- Shows service status (Ollama running, Tailscale connected, auto-start enabled)
- **What's Next** section with numbered steps:
  1. Complete Tailscale configuration (3 steps above)
  2. Install client on laptop/desktop (provides curl-pipe command)
  3. Test connection from client
- Troubleshooting commands section (restart Ollama, view logs)

### Design Principles
- Idempotent: safe to re-run without breaking existing setup
- User-friendly: minimal noise, clear visual hierarchy, actionable instructions
- Interactive: user controls pacing (press Enter when ready)
- Informative: context-specific error messages and troubleshooting tips
- Complete: guides user through entire workflow including client installation

## scripts/uninstall.sh

### Functionality
- Stops the Ollama LaunchAgent service via `launchctl bootout`
- Removes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.plist`
- Cleans up Ollama logs from `/tmp/` (`ollama.stdout.log`, `ollama.stderr.log`)
- Leaves Homebrew, Tailscale, and Ollama binary untouched (user may want to keep them)
- Leaves downloaded models in `~/.ollama/models/` untouched (valuable data)
- Handles edge cases gracefully (service not running, plist missing, partial installation)

### UX Requirements
- **Clear banner** - Display script name and purpose at start
- **Color-coded output** - Use echo -e with GREEN/YELLOW/RED for info/warn/error messages
- **Progress tracking** - Show what's being removed at each step
- **Final summary** - Display boxed or clearly separated summary section showing:
  - What was successfully removed
  - What was left intact (Homebrew, Tailscale, Ollama binary, models)
  - Any errors or warnings encountered
- **Graceful degradation** - Continue with remaining cleanup even if some steps fail
- **Idempotent** - Safe to re-run on already-cleaned system (no errors on missing files)

## scripts/warm-models.sh

### Functionality
- Accepts model names as command-line arguments (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder:32b deepseek-r1:70b`)
- Shows usage message if no models specified
- Verifies Ollama is running before proceeding (fail fast with clear error if not)
- For each model:
  - Pulls the model via `ollama pull <model>` (downloads if not present)
  - Sends lightweight `/v1/chat/completions` request to force-load into memory
    - Uses minimal prompt ("hi") with `max_tokens: 1`
- Continues on individual model failures (resilient)
- Includes comments documenting how to wire into launchd as post-boot warmup (optional)

### UX Requirements
- **Clear usage** - Show usage message with examples if invoked without arguments
- **Color-coded output** - Use echo -e with GREEN/YELLOW/RED for status messages
- **Progress per model** - Show clear status for each model:
  - "Pulling model..." (if download needed)
  - "Loading into memory..." (warm-up request)
  - "✓ Ready" (success) or "✗ Failed: <reason>" (error)
- **Progress indicators** - Show what's happening during long operations (pulling large models)
- **Final summary** - Display results at end:
  - Count of models successfully warmed
  - Count of models that failed (if any)
  - List of failed models with brief reason
- **Continue on failure** - Don't abort entire script if one model fails
- **Time estimates** - Optionally show estimated time remaining for large downloads

## scripts/test.sh

Comprehensive test script that validates all server functionality. Designed to run on the server machine after installation.

### Service Status Tests
- Verify LaunchAgent is loaded (`launchctl list | grep com.ollama`)
- Verify Ollama process is running as user (not root)
- Verify Ollama is listening on port 11434
- Verify service responds to basic HTTP requests

### API Endpoint Tests
- `GET /v1/models` - returns JSON model list
- `GET /v1/models/{model}` - returns single model details (requires at least one pulled model)
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` - non-streaming request succeeds
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` - streaming (`stream: true`) returns SSE chunks
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` - with `stream_options.include_usage` returns usage data
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` - JSON mode (`response_format: {"type": "json_object"}`)
- `POST /v1/responses` - experimental endpoint (note if requires Ollama 0.5.0+)

### Error Behavior Tests
- 500 error on inference with nonexistent model
- Appropriate error responses for malformed requests

### Security Tests
- Verify Ollama process owner is current user (not root)
- Verify log files exist and are readable (`/tmp/ollama.stdout.log`, `/tmp/ollama.stderr.log`)
- Verify plist file exists at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.plist`
- Verify `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` is set in plist environment variables

### Network Tests
- Verify service binds to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- Test local access via localhost
- Test local access via Tailscale IP (if Tailscale connected)
- Note: Testing from unauthorized client requires separate client-side test

### Output Format
- **Per-test results** - Clear pass/fail/skip for each test with brief description
- **Summary statistics** - Final count (X passed, Y failed, Z skipped)
- **Exit codes** - 0 if all tests pass, non-zero otherwise
- **Verbose mode** - `--verbose` or `-v` flag for detailed output (request/response bodies, timing)
- **Colorized output** - Use echo -e with color codes:
  - GREEN for passed tests
  - RED for failed tests
  - YELLOW for skipped tests
- **Progress indication** - Show test number / total (e.g., "Running test 5/20...")
- **Grouped results** - Organize output by test category (Service Status, API Endpoints, Security, Network)

### UX Requirements
- **Clear banner** - Display script name, purpose, and test count at start
- **Real-time feedback** - Show results as tests run (don't wait until end)
- **Minimal noise** - Suppress verbose curl output unless --verbose flag used
- **Helpful failures** - When test fails, show:
  - What was expected
  - What was received
  - Suggested troubleshooting steps
- **Skip guidance** - If tests are skipped, explain why and how to enable them
- **Final summary box** - Visually separated summary section with:
  - Overall pass/fail status
  - Statistics
  - Next steps if failures occurred

### Test Requirements
- Requires at least one model pulled for model-specific tests
- Can run with `--skip-model-tests` flag if no models available
- Non-destructive: does not modify server state (read-only API calls)

## No config files

Server requires no configuration files. All settings are managed via:
- Environment variables in the launchd plist (`OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`)
- Ollama's built-in configuration system
- Tailscale ACLs (managed via Tailscale admin console)
